# Customer-Segmentation-Prediction


## Project Description
Customer segmentation is a process to dividing customers into groups which possess common characteristics based on their age, gender, profession as well as interests. By doing so will enable the company to gain insights of customer’s needs or preferences, therefore the company will design a marketing strategy to target the most profitable segments.

Recently, there has been a decline in revenue for the bank and investigation has been carried out to identify the root of the problem. The bank found out that the reduce in revenue is mainly due to decrement of the deposition of money into the bank by the clients. Hence, the bank decided to conduct marketing campaigns to persuade more clients to deposit money into the bank.

The purpose of marketing campaign is to collect customer’s needs and overall satisfaction. There are a few essential aspects of the marketing campaign namely, customer segmentation, promotional strategy, and etc. Correctly identified strategy may help to expand and grow the bank’s revenue.

For this project, by using the dataset from the marketing campaigns to develop deep learning model to predict the outcome of the campaign. To know whether the people attending the campaign are subscribed for term deposit or not.

# How to Install and Run the Project
To run this model on your pc, you may need to download all things inside the repository. All the folder inside are already arranged according to the coding, so it's not recommend to change the folder path such as model to another path. By using the spyder you may can run the customer_segmentation_train.py to get the result, make sure that customer_segmentation_module.py are in the same path to running the coding without any error.

Software required: Spyder, Python(preferably the latest version)

Additional modules needed: Tensorflow, Sklearn, matplotlib, missingno
